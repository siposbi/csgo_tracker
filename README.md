# CSGO: MM Tracker

A CS:GO matchmaking statistics tracker app.  
In this app you can add your recent matches. After adding them, they are shown in a list, where you can delete them.  
Firebase Firestore is used for storing your matches, so you can view them on multiple devices.

This app is meant to be used just for fun and should not be taken seriously, because it might be shut down in any moment.

## Known bugs

Feel free to open issues, but I probably will not fix most of them.  
1, Some element of the design falls apart when viewed on a phone, using the web build.
